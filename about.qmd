I come from a supply chain background but gradually found myself getting more and more into software development. I've used Ruby, R and Python more or less extensively but these days I mostly use Java and Spring.
I've worked on four continents, mostly at the intersection between training/knowledge management, IT and supply chain management in both the private and humanitarian sectors.

Languages are a source of endless fascination for me. I speak five of them fluently and learning Mandarin currently helps keep me busy.

I enjoy working as part of multidisciplinary teams and prefer remote assignments.

I founded and used to run the Hamburg R user group.
