    "text": "ChatGPT could have written this blog post in an instant. And if other prompts I’ve given it are any indication, it would have done a pretty good job, too. If I wasn’t happy with the results, I could ask follow up questions or ask it to adjust the tone and it would have gradually refined its output to meet my expectations.\nThis raises the question of what the value is of human-produced content. If I had asked a fellow human to write this post, I would have had to wait longer to get a result, and I’m not sure it would necessarily be better than what ChatGPT would have produced. But this way of asking questions about the value of written content might be missing the point.\nWhat if instead of focusing on the output, we focused on what writing does to the writer? After all, one reason so many people are using AIs to write things for them is that the process of is laborious and tiring. You not only need to gather the material you want to write about, but you also need to work on your idea so that it takes form on the page. This requires clarifying your thoughts, brining assumptions into focus, and looking for the right words which is the same as saying you need to find how to express something in a nuanced and rigurous way. In this process, ideas are iteratively enriched and refined in a way that reveals deeper aspects of them to you all the while helping you internalise them.\nThinking AI tools will make writing skills irrelevant is like thinking forklifts will make barbells obsolete. You can’t compete with a forklift no matter how much you train, but a forklift won’t make you any stronger, either. So if your goal is to move a pile of bricks, then by all means use a forklift, but if what you want is to work on building your own strength, then find some barbells to lift.\nSimilarly, if what you want is clear and rigurous thought, write. An AI can produce the output faster than you can, but it can’t change you the way writing changes you."

    "text": "At 35 years old and after massive adoption, Python is definitely a mature language. It’s also become the language of choice for data science, machine learning and AI development. However, using it for web development still often requires using other languages which themselves can have steep learning curves and add to the complexity of even simple projects.\nThat’s why I was so excited when FastHTML came out in 2024. In case you missed it, FastHTML allows you to create HTML pages written entirely in Python where Python functions replace HTML tags. This meant you could develop web applications without leaving Python as was needed until now with Django or Flask. FastHTML is the new kid on the block and isn’t as mature nor does it have as widespread a user base as the other two, but the ease of use suggest adoption will be coming along given enough time.\nStill, actually getting a page of your machine and into the cloud to be served to users still required using cloud providers. And although some paired down PaaS offerings have come along with flatter learning curves than AWS or GC (such as Railway or Render), you still needed a lot of manual set up to configure databases, servers, set up rules for scaling and elasticity, etc.\nAnswer.ai (the company behind FastHTML) have now unveiled a new hosting service that promises to allow you to deploy directly using Python with minima set up. The service is still in beta and therefor probably not ready for anything mission critical, but I decided to give it a spin.\nAfter creating a new folder and creating a Python venv environment, I installed the very minimum tools required to bring the most basic page online using FastHTML:\npip install python-fasthtml\npip install monsterui\npip install plash-cli\nAnd that’s it. MonsterUI provides reusable CSS components for styling FastHTML sites. The selling point is it should make Tailwind a breeze to use (pun!).\nThe plash-cli tool is a command line tool that handles everything about deployment for you. A nice touch is how it authenticates you the first time you set it up. You run the command plash login and a browser window opens up. If you’re logged into your Plash account on the dashboard, then that’s it, you’re authenticated!\nNext, I built the most minimal hello world FastHTML page you can build using MonsterUI:\nfrom fasthtml.common import  *\n\nfrom monsterui.all import  *\n\n  \n\napp, rt = fast_app(hdrs=Theme.blue.headers())\n\n  \n\n@rt('/')\n\ndef  get():\n\nreturn Titled(\"Hello world!\",\n\nCard(H2(\"This is my helloworld!\")),\n\nP(\"This app uses MonsterUI for styling.\"))\n\n  \n\nserve()\nOne particularity of Plash is it requires you to include a requirements.txt file listing any packages you need in the same folder as the rest of the stuff you’ll be deploying. Here’s what my requirements.txt looks like:\npython-fasthtml\n\nmonsterui\nNow, I was ready to deploy. I ran plash deploy in the command line and minute later, my page was accessible at https://dazzling-otter-descends-rur.pla.sh/.\nTo call this a web project would be a massive exageration, but I enjoyed testing out the flow from FastHTML file creation to deployment and will be exploring other functionality like deploying persistent memory and more complex apps in the coming days and weeks.\nThings are looking up for web develin the Python world!"

    "title": "Leap exercise on Exercism",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Yesterday was February 29th, a rare occasion that only happens once every four years and to celebrate it I solved the leap exercise on Exercism. This is something of a classic problem. Your assignment is to write a method that given a year will tell us if it’s a leap year or not. Leap years satisfy the following conditions: 1. Must be divisible by 4 2. Years evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years, unless… 3. they’re divisible by 400\nAnytime you think of something being “evenly divisible” you should think of the modulo operator, which appears in every programming language I’ve ever studied. In Java and elsewhere it’s represented by a percentage sign (%), and the result of a dividend modulo a divisor is the remainder of a division with the same numbers.\nSo for example, 4 divided by 2, has a remainder of 0, which is the same as saying 4 % 2 gives 0.\nThe number 5, on the other hand, is an odd number and therefor isn’t evenly divisible by 2. It gives a remainder of 1, or we could say 5 % 2 gives 1.\nArmed with this knowledge, it’s fairly straightforward to solve the problem using if statements to classify different years. My solution is here and looks like this:\nclass Leap {\n\n    boolean isLeapYear(int year) {\n        if (year % 4 == 0) {\n            if (year % 100 == 0) {\n                if (year % 400 == 0){\n                    return true;\n                }\n                return false;\n            }\n            return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n}\nThis solution is fine if not particularly elegant.\nThe dig deeper section of this exercise had a few interesting insights. They showed a solution that only uses chained boolean expressions to avoid using if statements, which resut in a single line of code but I’m not convinced it’s so much more readable.\nA much more interesting approach to me is the one that uses the ternary operator:\nboolean isLeapYear(int year) {\n    return year % 100 == 0 ? year % 400 == 0 : year % 4 == 0;\n}\nHere divisibility by 100 is tested first and determines if we check for divisibility by 400. If false we return whether the year is divisible by 4. The explanatory text points out this actually starts from an edge case, but I find it’s a great example to introduce ternary operators to students, so will try to remember this example.\nFinally, of course, the idiomatic solution for Java feels a bit like a cheat. Need to know if a year is a leap year? There’s an API for that:\nimport java.time.Year;\n\nclass Leap {\n\n    boolean isLeapYear(int year) {\n        return Year.of(year).isLeap();\n    }\n}"
